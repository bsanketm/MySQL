Q What is Database?

Place Where Data is Stored is called Database.
A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed.

Q. Why Database is required?
Databases support good data access because: Large volumes of data can be stored in one place. Multiple users can read and modify the data at the same time. Databases are searchable and sortable, so the data you need can be found quick and easily.

DBMS is the software system that allows users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database. DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete data in database. It is a layer between programs and data.
Advantages of DBMS
1.Reducing Data Redundancy : Deals with Duplicate Data
2.Sharing of Data : Many remote users can also access the database simultaneously and share the data between themselves.
3.Privacy : Only the authorized users can access a database according to its privacy constraints.
4.Backup and Recovery : DBMS automatically takes care of backup and recovery
5.Data Consistency : Data consistency is ensured in a database because there is no data redundancy. All data appears consistently across the database and the data is same for all the users viewing the database.

In Database we can store any type of data string, Number, Char, Images, Audio etc.

Types of DBMS
1.Hierarchical database.
2.Network database.
3.Relational database.
4.Object-Oriented database.


Out of this RDBMS (Relational  Database Management System) is most commonly used.
Advantages of RDBMS 
1.Data is Stored as Tables.
2.Multiple data elements can be accessed at same time.
3.Data is present in multiple tables which can be related to each other.
4.Normalization can be achieved.
5.supports distributed databases.
6.Deals with large quantity of data.
7.Data Redundancy can be reduced using key and indexes in RDBMS.
8.Supports multiple users at a time.
9.RDBMS has multilayer security during data manipulation. Security Providers are Oracle, SQL Server.

In RDBMS MySQL is most commonly used Everywhere.
MySQL is powered by Oracle Corporation & it is Popular because it is open source, Cost is Low, Flexible & Scalable, Secure Also tools like workbench is available.
Name MySQL derived from co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter i.e. My and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.
